### Reflection
1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation.
- The problem I went through in this unit was making quiz using javascript, I used some javascript elements to create the website but making quiz was definitely the harderst one. I overcame the problem by looking throught the code, and understanding the each code step by step, and researching about javascript elements. The code I used a lot was if/else statement. It was useful to set status class of right or wrong depends on the answer user put, and showing scores.

2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.
- At first, I didn't know anything about computer or coding, so it was hard for me to understand the concept of how to code especially c program or javascript where I need to use more complex coding. I started to understanding step by step by watching videos about it and completing the exercises about it. For example, if I want to know the numeber of dividend / divisor, I can just make int, and ask for the numbers, make int of dividend / divisor, and printf that int.(this is for floored answer) By indentifying the tasks to do in order to achieve the goal, I gained the skill of problem solving and thinking sequentially.
  
3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.
- Making the website using html, css and javascript. I had no idea how to make website before, but now I learned them and I can make basic of page using html, and adding nice elements such as colors and buttons using css, and I can make webpage interactive by using javascript such as flashcard and quiz. 
  
4. In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain.
- Computer made our lives to get better, we can call people anytime, search things, watch movies etc... There are manuy things that we can do with computer, and it also improved healthcare and education, too. Computers are integrated into our lives, and improved our lives better.
  
5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain
- Computers, especially phone is likely to cause addiction, which affect the mental health. Also, early age of usage of computer affect brain, physical and mental development. I think computers are useful and improved our lives, but also it has bad effects depending on how to use them.
  
6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?
- I think because of computerised society, no matter I do IT related work or no, it is very important to know about computer, and know how it works. Also, this class developed my skill of solving problems step by step. This experience of taking the computer science has positive impact on my future regarding huge skill I gained in this class.
